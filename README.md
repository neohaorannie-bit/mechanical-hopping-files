Supporting files for mechanical hopping

All the COMSOL files are constructed but the calculated results is not saved because of the large size of files.
Click 'calculate' button  to solve the system. 

Regarding the function of gradient potential, the slope can be controlled by controlling the "grd" parameter. 
Alternatively, change the onsite potential by changing the "an1" or "an2" global function for specific documents.

"VHI_gradient_chain.mph" corresponding to results in Fig. 4 in the main text. 
"zigzag 2D mode.mph" corresponding to results in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 in the main text.
"zigzag spec.mph" corresponds to results in Fig. 5 in the main text.
"VHI_negative_chain.mph", "VHI_negative_bulk_I.mph","VHI_negative_bulk_zigzag1.mph" and "VHI_negative_bulk_zigzag2.mph" corresponds to Fig. 6.
"armed chair spec.mph" and "armed chair 2D mode.mph" corresponds to Fig. S4 in Supporting Information.
